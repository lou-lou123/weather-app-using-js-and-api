# weather-app-using-js-and-api
Created weather app that calls the API to check weather for a city.
## Introduction
As explained above. Although it is basic, it was a interesting project that taught me more about how to use APIs and js to create something useful. This was created during Academy Xi bootcamp.

It is worth noting the API key is removed to avoid abuse or misuse.
